# api_stress_test
Stress test your APIs.

This Python 3 script creates threads and makes GET or POST API calls to any endpoint you specify. Use this only on your own APIs to stress test and see how many concurrent requests your server can support, as well as testing the rate limit of your APIs.

To run: ```python3 stress_test.py``` 

##### External Dependency: 
- Python3 requests
